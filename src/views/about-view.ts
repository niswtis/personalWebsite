            My name is Aristides Nisotakis but my friends call me Aris. I am from Heraklion, Crete, Greece. Having lived and studied in Heraklion I have learned to love my city and all itâ€™s beauties while staying fascinated when exploring new places. In my free time I love to create stuff digitally such as taking photos and editing them, or developing web applications such as this one. Motivated by progressiveness and fueled by good music.

            My journey in Web Development started from University when I took some courses in Web Programming and UI/UX design. Throughout those courses I have developed  front ends for an e-commerce and a video conference website (UI/UX) as well as a fully functional while quite basic social network website. My interest though was peaked when I landed a position for a company based in the Netherlands as a part of my Erasmus+ Internship. Throughout that experience I learned a lot of the fundamentals of the Web Development Stack in conjunction with working as a part of the team and by the end of it the journey for carreer in Web Development has begun.
